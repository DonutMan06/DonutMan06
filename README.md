## Welcome on my GitHub !

I'm a research engineer in a geomagnetism group and I like to create some code from time to time as a hobby.
Even if I code for a long time now, I'm quite new here since I didn't share my work (which is not really big stuff but just some little investigations on questions that puzzled me)


## What will you find here ?

Mostly functions in Python, Matlab or C that let me investigate some questions around the literature thematic, but processed with a mathematician point of view (with concepts such as graph theory or linear algebra).

For example, I analysed a french thesaurus and tried to extract interesting properties.
- If you start from a given word and you look at its synonyms, you obtain a set of words.
- If you iterate and look at the synonyms of each word of this set, you obtain a (possibly bigger) second set.
- If you iterate on this set and so on, you construct word sets which will be bigger and bigger until it eventually stabilizes.

This main thematic has been somehow influenced by the french [Oulipo group](https://www.oulipo.net/) (François Le Lionnais, Raymond Queneau, Georges Perec)

I also aim to share here some other projects that are linked to signal processing and fast Fourier transform analysis.
For example, I developped a little tool to estimate if I sing in tune.

More interesting, I tried to estimate if the ability to stay in tune is impacted by the input frequency and its distance from the western muscial scale.
To put it in other words, is a A (440 Hz) easier to reproduce than, for example, a slightly shifted A at 440 Hz + <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\varepsilon"> ?

There are a lot more questions that can be asked around this singing thematic. Is our ability to sing in tune influenced by the time window ?
If it's relatively easy to hold a note that we listen at the same time, it eventually becomes harder and harder to hold the very same frequency once the input is no more listened.


## How to run the different projects ?

Usually, each project comes with a README.md which describe how to install and run it.

Moreover, for each project there will be a full article on [my blog](https://blog.les-vigneron.fr) that describe the main results and points of interest.
